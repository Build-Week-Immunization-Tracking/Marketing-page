                <p>Jason and Richard (pictured below in order) were responsible for setting up our database, setting up USERS table and seeds and then migrating them. Parts of the project they were also responsible for were to set up the USERS models and USERS routes in addition to setting up a server, middleware, setting up the authorization and hashing, and last, but not least, setting up CORS.  </p>

            <h2>Front-End Developers</h2>

            <p>Gul, Adan, and Steven (pictured below in order) were given the reins to build the Register View and components. This had to have two options for both users and staff. They also had to build the login view and components as well as set up the authorization and Axios requests for Login and Register. Overall, their goal was to focus their attention on functionality before styling.</p>
